# Complete ALL Architecture solves for ROPEMPORIUM

## Introduction
This repo contains all the solves for each ROPEMPORIUM challenge on [ROPEMPORIUM](https://ropemporium.com/). This includes all architectures (x86_64, x86, MIPS, ARMV5). This started out as a introduction to Return Oriented Programming, but ended as also a great resource and hands on challenge on exploiting other architectures (than the usual x86 or x64 binaries). It is a great resource for getting familiar with the calling conventions of the challenge's architectures as well as learning intricacies of each language (e.g. delay slot in MIPS and thumb mode in ARM).

There are no writeups for any of the solves at the moment, as there are a multitude of guides already found online for them. I may include in the future writeups for the ARM solves as there is an apparent lack of writeups for those in comaprison to the other three ARCH's.
